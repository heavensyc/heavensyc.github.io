 This is not true. Let's say you have the moon and a spaceship orbiting the earth, in the same orbit. The earth's gravity will exert the same amount of pull on both the moon and the spaceship. HOWEVER, you're missing the fact that the objects orbiting also exerts a pull on earth, which means the moon would have to move faster than the spaceship to maintain the same orbit.
To prove this, let's look at the formula for orbital speed, which says that v = √((m1+m2)*G)/r, where r is the distance between the center of the earth and the object, G is the gravitational constant (6.674×10−11), and m1 and m2 are the masses of earth and the object orbiting. Intuetively looking at the formula, and you'll see that the spaceship doesn't need to move as fast as the moon to stay in the same orbit, because less mass is inputted into the formula.</p>

<p id="destinypara">  Destiny is a cool dude!  <a href="www.destiny.gg/embed/chat"> My Hero </a> </br>I saw Destiny at a starbucks in Omaha yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn't want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.
He said, "Oh, like you're doing now?”
I was taken aback, and all I could say was ech but he kept cutting me off and going ech ech and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my memes, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen DANKMEMES in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like "Sir, you need to pay for those first." At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the memes and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually "to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don't even think that's a word. After she scanned each meme and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly and told her he's the text to voice master of the universe and walked out.</p>
